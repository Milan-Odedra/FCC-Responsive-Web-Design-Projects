Let the brain, the body, muscles, nerves, every part of your body be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success, and this is the way great spiritual giants are produced.” - Fun fact: later in the film "Batman Begins" Ra al Ghul tells batman the same thing 100 years ahead. 
      </li>
      <li><strong>1902</strong> - dies at the age of 39.</li>
